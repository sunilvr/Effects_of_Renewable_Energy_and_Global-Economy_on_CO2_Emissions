# Effects of Renewable Energy & Global Economy on CO2 Emissions (Data Analysis and Visualisations)
The project used pandas and pyplot libraries in python to analyse and visualise renewable energy consumption as a percentage of total final energy consumption and how it relates to the Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) across countries. The multi-format data (JSON and XML) collected from various sources were stored in MongoDB and PostgreSQL followed by data processing, analysis, and visualisations (shown in visualisations.html file).
